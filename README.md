This is my CS370 course final projects where we demonstrated our ability to write an AI capable of solving a maze.  Additionally we ran several experimental trials to see how each hidden layer and element of the AI affected its learning.

The .ipynb file is the culmination of documentation and code written throughout the course, and an explanation of what each code block does.

The word file is a follow up essay written to show comprehension of how AI learns and how it differs from human learning.
